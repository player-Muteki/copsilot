# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-31

First public beta release.

### Changed
- Context arc meter moved to right of "Copsilot" title in header.
- All slash commands now route through ACP agent — removed local `compact` interception.
- `isBuiltInCommand()` always returns false; no commands are handled locally.
- Toolbar redesigned as single row: model selector, mode cycle button, effort dropdown, permission cycle, send button.
- Context arc meter moved to header bar, freeing toolbar space.
- Mode selector changed from segmented button group to single click-to-cycle button.
- Permission toggle uses color-coded border (green/amber/orange) instead of dot indicator.
- Sending indicator merged into send button (button turns red "Stop" during generation).

## 0.0.41 - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- Context meter redesigned as semicircle arc gauge — SVG arc fills from left to right, percentage text on right.
- Effort selector now uses custom hover dropdown instead of native `<select>`, matching model selector style.
- All toolbar elements now use consistent custom UI (no native form controls).

## 0.0.40 - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Fix token usage tracking: restore `response.usage` handling from prompt response (primary token source).
- Fix token usage tracking: `usage_update` notification now merges with existing response usage instead of overwriting.
- Fix toolbar spacing: consistent 6px gap between elements, model selector flex fills, permission toggle auto-pushes right.

## 0.0.39 - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Fix session stability: `send()` no longer shows error UI when connection is already lost.
- Fix session stability: reconnect now shows a recovery prompt instead of silently losing the in-flight message.
- Fix session stability: `ensureRuntimeSession` falls back to creating a new session when sync fails.
- Fix abort race condition in `AcpJsonRpcTransport` — abort handler checks if request is still pending.
- Fix token usage tracking: enhanced `parseSessionUpdate` field fallback for different server versions.
- Remove dead `response.usage` code path (opencode returns empty object from prompt).

### Changed
- Toolbar split into two rows: top row (model selector + mode buttons), bottom row (effort + context meter + permission + send).
- Idle timeout now disabled when set to 0 (short-circuit instead of wrapping in timeout logic).
- Added debug logging for `usage_update` notifications.

## 0.0.38 - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Add a compact "liquid glass" context usage meter in the toolbar.
- Context meter shows percentage, warning/critical states, and token details on hover.

### Changed
- Usage updates now refresh the toolbar meter during streaming and after final response usage is received.

## 0.0.37 - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- Agent mode selector now uses segmented button group instead of native `<select>`.
- Added permission mode toggle in toolbar (safe → plan → yolo cycle).
- Permission toggle shows color indicator (green/yellow/orange) for current mode.

## 0.0.36 - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Fix model list not loading on initial connection - now syncs saved session before loading toolbar options.
- Fix model list not loading after reconnect - clears session state on disconnect so reconnect forces reload.
- Fix abort handler in `AcpJsonRpcTransport` to properly reject with `AcpAbortError`.

### Changed
- Model selector now uses custom hover dropdown instead of native `<select>`, with provider grouping.
- Idle timeout is now configurable via Settings (default 300000ms, 0 to disable).
- `disposeConnection()` now clears session state (sessionId, stream handler, normalizer).

## 0.0.35 - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Fix toolbar options not loading after reconnect - now calls `loadToolbarOptions()` after connection establishment.
- Fix abort handler in `AcpJsonRpcTransport` to not prematurely reject with `AcpAbortError`, allowing proper request cleanup.

### Changed
- Prompt requests now use transport-level timeout of 0 (disabled), matching claudian's `ACP_PROMPT_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` approach. The idle timeout in `AgentRuntime` handles cancellation instead.
- `AgentRuntime.sendMessage` now throws `AcpTimeoutError` instead of generic error for timeout, providing better error classification.

## 0.0.34 - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- Fix session output interruption by removing unnecessary server cancel request during abort.
- Fix error banner showing on user-initiated cancellation (AcpAbortError now properly suppressed).
- Fix plugin not reconnecting when view opens - now always attempts connection on view open.

### Changed
- `stopGeneration()` now only calls `abort()` without sending `session/cancel` to server.
- `AcpJsonRpcTransport` no longer sends cancel request when abort signal is triggered.
- View now always tries to connect when opened, regardless of `autoConnect` setting.

## 0.0.33 - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Enhance `PermissionBanner` with tool kind badge, location list, and input parameter summary.
- Add CSS styles for new permission UI elements (kind badge, locations, input summary).

### Changed
- Permission banner now shows: tool type badge (e.g., READ, EDIT, EXECUTE), file paths (up to 3), and key input parameters.
- Improved permission banner layout with better visual hierarchy.

## 0.0.32 - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Add `writeTextFile` method to `FsDelegate` for vault file writing with boundary protection.
- Register `fs/write_text_file` handler for OpenCode agent to write vault files.
- Add `readonly` option to `FsCapabilityMode` for read-only file system access.
- Update `clientCapabilities.fs.writeTextFile` based on FS capability mode.

### Changed
- FS capability mode now supports three options: `enabled` (read/write), `readonly` (read only), `disabled` (no access).
- Default FS capability mode is `enabled` (read & write).

## 0.0.31 - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Add `TerminalManager` class for terminal process lifecycle management (create, output, kill, release, waitForExit).
- Register 5 terminal handlers: `terminal/create`, `terminal/output`, `terminal/kill`, `terminal/release`, `terminal/wait_for_exit`.
- Declare `clientCapabilities.terminal = true` in ACP initialize request.
- Add `TerminalCapabilityMode` setting (enabled/disabled) to control terminal access.
- Add terminal timeout setting (default 30000ms) and max output buffer size setting (default 100000 bytes).
- Add `setTerminalCapabilityMode()` method to `AcpClient` and `AgentRuntime`.
- Add unit tests for `TerminalManager` lifecycle operations.

### Security
- Terminal commands run in vault directory by default.
- Output buffer limited to prevent OOM.
- Process timeout prevents hanging commands.

## 0.0.30 - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Add `FsDelegate` class for vault-boundary file system access with path traversal protection.
- Register `fs/read_text_file` handler for OpenCode agent to read vault files.

- Add `FsCapabilityMode` setting (enabled/disabled) to control file system access.
- Add `setFsCapabilityMode()` method to `AcpClient` and `AgentRuntime`.
- Add unit tests for `FsDelegate` vault boundary checks and file reading.

### Changed
- Agent can now read files within the vault boundary when FS capability is enabled.
- File size limited by `maxNoteSize` setting (default 8000 bytes).
- Files exceeding the limit are truncated with `... [truncated]` suffix.

## 0.0.29 - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Add `AbortSignal` support to `AcpJsonRpcTransport.request()` for request-level cancellation.
- Add `AcpAbortError` error type for aborted requests.
- Add `abort()` method to `AcpClient` and `AgentRuntime` for external cancellation.
- Add error classification UI with retry/restart buttons for timeout and process exit errors.
- Add `addError()` action parameter to `ChatRenderer` for inline error actions.

### Changed
- `AcpClient.sendMessage()` now uses `AbortController` for cancellation.
- `stopGeneration()` calls `abort()` to immediately cancel in-flight JSON-RPC requests.
- Removed DOM references from `ChatState` (`currentTextEl`, `ThinkingState.el`, `pendingTools[].parentEl`, `toolCallEls`, `planEl`).
- Error messages now show contextual action buttons (retry for timeout, restart for process exit).

### Tested
- Updated tests for `ChatState`, `AcpClient`, and `CopsilotViewController` to reflect new abort behavior.

## 0.0.28 - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Extracted business/session/streaming logic from `CopsilotView` into new `CopsilotViewController` class.
- View now handles only DOM creation, UI event binding, and Obsidian lifecycle hooks.

### Added

## 0.0.23 - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Add `requestWithFallback` to `AcpClient` to gracefully handle method name changes across different OpenCode CLI versions, falling back to legacy JSON-RPC method aliases when encountering `-32601` (Method not found) errors.
