# Changelog

## 0.0.16 - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Extract WelcomeView component from CopsidianView for welcome page rendering and connection status display.
- Add event-driven i18n locale change mechanism (`onLocaleChange`) so child components self-manage locale updates instead of relying on parent imperative calls.
- Add unit tests for DragDropManager (6 tests), PermissionBanner (3 tests), InlineEditPanel (5 tests), and Mutex (3 tests).

### Changed
- ChatInput, InputToolbar, ChatRenderer, InlineEditPanel, DragDropManager, PermissionBanner, and WelcomeView register their own locale change listeners in constructors.
- Simplify CopsidianView.refreshLocale() by removing manual child component locale update calls.

## 0.0.15 - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- Sanitize sync note paths to prevent path traversal, absolute paths, drive letters, and illegal filename characters.
- Support `rawInput.path` fallback in sync rule path matching alongside existing `filePath`.
- Restore custom system prompt value display in Settings text area.
- Extract actual edited content from fenced code blocks in inline edit responses, stripping surrounding explanation text.
- Clean up ACP stream lifecycle: clear `activeStreamSessionId` and `chunkHandler` on complete/cancel, null out process reference on close.
- Use `once('close')` with kill fallback and 2s timeout in `disconnect()` to prevent hangs.

### Changed
- Extract drag-and-drop logic into `DragDropManager` component.
- Extract permission approval UI into `PermissionBanner` component.
- Extract inline edit diff panel into `InlineEditPanel` component.
- Replace manual ACP stdout buffer concatenation with `readline` interface for cleaner JSON-RPC line parsing.
- Change agent request timeout from fixed 5-minute total to idle timeout that resets on each streaming chunk.
- Add `Mutex` to `SyncEngine.process()` and session management to prevent concurrent Vault write conflicts and session race conditions.

## 0.0.14 - 2026-05-23

### Changed
- Defer OpenCode connection until first user action (send message or create session).
- Remove automatic connection during plugin startup, settings page load, and view initialization.
- Change autoConnect default from true to false for new installations.

### Tested
- Add regression tests for deferred connection behavior.
- Verify plugin loads without blocking on OpenCode connection.

## 0.0.13 - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Preserve configured MCP servers when restoring existing OpenCode sessions.
- Initialize autocomplete after the chat input area is created.
- Deduplicate Copsidian side leaves during plugin reload/open stress scenarios.
- Make Copsidian view cleanup safe before the view finishes opening.

### Tested

## 0.0.12 - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- Document custom agents and reusable custom skills in the English and Chinese feature lists.
- Mark completed roadmap and phase-plan items as done.

## 0.0.11 - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Add local custom agents and reusable custom skills with settings management and prompt injection.
- Load runtime agents, models, and skills/commands in Settings, and manage common models there.
- Limit the chat model selector to configured common models when common models are selected.

### Changed
- Apply configured default agent, model, and effort to newly created OpenCode sessions.

### Tested
- Add regression coverage for custom agent validation, prompt composition, common model filtering, runtime settings loading, and default session options.

## 0.0.10 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Keep ACP permission requests responsive when the Obsidian permission UI handler fails by falling back to a safe reject decision.
- Align ACP initialize client metadata with the plugin release version.

### Tested
- Re-ran the full test suite five times during pressure testing and added ACP regression coverage for permission fallback handling.
- Cover live plugin settings language refresh alongside open chat view refresh.

## 0.0.9 - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Mark inline edit with diff preview as complete and add regression coverage for preview, apply, discard, and locale refresh behavior.

## 0.0.8 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Apply saved English/Chinese language settings on plugin startup and refresh both the plugin settings tab and open Copsidian views immediately after changing language in Settings.
- Complete i18n coverage for runtime notices, toolbar tooltips, inline edit UI and prompt, usage tooltips, sync failure messages, ACP errors, and default session titles.
- Harden permission handling so `safe` mode does not auto-approve tool requests when no UI permission handler is available.
- Prevent connection failures from blocking sidebar initialization, and avoid false “connected” states after failed reconnect attempts.
- Reject pending ACP requests when the OpenCode process exits or stdin is unavailable.
- Clear stale inline-edit state after apply, discard, session reset, or subsequent sends.
- Surface sync rule failures in the chat UI instead of only logging them to the console.
- Use byte-accurate note truncation and real file sizes for image attachment limits.

### Changed
- Split normal build and release packaging so `npm run build` validates version consistency without mutating release artifacts, while `npm run release` prepares release files.
- Update GitHub release workflow to use the release packaging script.

## 0.0.7 - 2026-05-21
