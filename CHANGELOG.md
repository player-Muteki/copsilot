# Changelog

## 0.0.11 - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Add local custom agents and reusable custom skills with settings management and prompt injection.
- Load runtime agents, models, and skills/commands in Settings, and manage common models there.
- Limit the chat model selector to configured common models when common models are selected.

### Changed
- Apply configured default agent, model, and effort to newly created OpenCode sessions.

### Tested
- Add regression coverage for custom agent validation, prompt composition, common model filtering, runtime settings loading, and default session options.

## 0.0.10 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Keep ACP permission requests responsive when the Obsidian permission UI handler fails by falling back to a safe reject decision.
- Align ACP initialize client metadata with the plugin release version.

### Tested
- Re-ran the full test suite five times during pressure testing and added ACP regression coverage for permission fallback handling.
- Cover live plugin settings language refresh alongside open chat view refresh.

## 0.0.9 - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Mark inline edit with diff preview as complete and add regression coverage for preview, apply, discard, and locale refresh behavior.

## 0.0.8 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Apply saved English/Chinese language settings on plugin startup and refresh both the plugin settings tab and open Copsidian views immediately after changing language in Settings.
- Complete i18n coverage for runtime notices, toolbar tooltips, inline edit UI and prompt, usage tooltips, sync failure messages, ACP errors, and default session titles.
- Harden permission handling so `safe` mode does not auto-approve tool requests when no UI permission handler is available.
- Prevent connection failures from blocking sidebar initialization, and avoid false “connected” states after failed reconnect attempts.
- Reject pending ACP requests when the OpenCode process exits or stdin is unavailable.
- Clear stale inline-edit state after apply, discard, session reset, or subsequent sends.
- Surface sync rule failures in the chat UI instead of only logging them to the console.
- Use byte-accurate note truncation and real file sizes for image attachment limits.

### Changed
- Split normal build and release packaging so `npm run build` validates version consistency without mutating release artifacts, while `npm run release` prepares release files.
- Update GitHub release workflow to use the release packaging script.

## 0.0.7 - 2026-05-21
