# Changelog

## 0.0.25 - 2026-05-26

### Tooling
- Add ESLint, Prettier, simple-git-hooks, and lint-staged configuration for conservative TypeScript linting and formatting.
- Ignore generated build artifacts, release output, and local QA vault data.
- Add a non-blocking CI lint step.

### Documentation
- Add English and Chinese ACP capability matrices to the README.

### Known issues
- `npm run lint` currently reports 32 warnings in existing source files.

## 0.0.24 - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Add typed ACP agent capabilities covering session, prompt, MCP, and authentication metadata.
- Show OpenCode authentication methods in the welcome view with terminal login guidance when reported by the agent.

### Changed
- Drive session dropdown controls, image drag-and-drop, and MCP type options from negotiated agent capabilities.
- Disable unsupported session and MCP actions with localized explanatory labels.

### Tested
- Add unit coverage for welcome auth method rendering, session capability combinations, image drop rejection, and MCP type disabling.

## 0.0.23 - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Add `requestWithFallback` to `AcpClient` to gracefully handle method name changes across different OpenCode CLI versions, falling back to legacy JSON-RPC method aliases when encountering `-32601` (Method not found) errors. Cache successful method names to eliminate redundant fallback attempts on subsequent calls.

## 0.0.22

### Added
- Added support for `http` and `sse` MCP servers in settings and ACP configuration output.
- Added support for `terminal` content in `tool_call_update` payloads for future terminal capabilities.
- Added `mimeType` property to `PromptPart.resource` in types.
- Added unit tests covering the new discriminated unions for MCP server configurations.

### Changed
- Converted `McpServerConfig` into a discriminated union.
- Updated settings UI to display a Type dropdown for selecting `stdio`, `http`, or `sse` MCP servers.

## 0.0.21 - 2026-05-26

### Changed

  - `client/AcpMethodNames.ts` — 25 tests for ACP method name aliases
  - `view/renderer.ts` — 31 tests for ChatRenderer message rendering

## 0.0.20 - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

## 0.0.19 - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- Integrate AcpJsonRpcTransport into AcpClient, replacing inline readline/JSON-RPC logic
- Integrate AcpSubprocess into AcpClient, replacing direct child_process.spawn usage

- Add 37 new unit tests for AcpJsonRpcTransport, AcpSubprocess, and AcpErrors (202 total)

## 0.0.18 - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- Extract ACP client layer into modular components for better maintainability:
  - `AcpMethodNames.ts` — Logical method name aliases for OpenCode CLI version compatibility
  - `AcpJsonRpcTransport.ts` — JSON-RPC transport with timeout support and notification handlers
  - `AcpSubprocess.ts` — Process lifecycle management (spawn, shutdown, stderr capture)
  - `AcpErrors.ts` — Hierarchical error types (transport, protocol, timeout, process exit)

## 0.0.17 - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- Add `reject_always` to permission option kinds for correct safe-mode rejection handling.
- Parse and store `agentCapabilities` from ACP initialize response for capability negotiation.
- Persist `sessionInfo` (sessionId, title, cwd) from `session_info_update` into client snapshot.
- Add `audio` content type to `PromptPart` for ACP protocol alignment.
- Support MCP server environment variable configuration in settings UI and ACP transport.

## 0.0.16 - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Extract WelcomeView component from CopsidianView for welcome page rendering and connection status display.
- Add event-driven i18n locale change mechanism (`onLocaleChange`) so child components self-manage locale updates instead of relying on parent imperative calls.
- Add unit tests for DragDropManager (6 tests), PermissionBanner (3 tests), InlineEditPanel (5 tests), and Mutex (3 tests).

### Changed
- ChatInput, InputToolbar, ChatRenderer, InlineEditPanel, DragDropManager, PermissionBanner, and WelcomeView register their own locale change listeners in constructors.
- Simplify CopsidianView.refreshLocale() by removing manual child component locale update calls.

## 0.0.15 - 2026-05-25

- Support `rawInput.path` fallback in sync rule path matching alongside existing `filePath`.
- Restore custom system prompt value display in Settings text area.
- Extract actual edited content from fenced code blocks in inline edit responses, stripping surrounding explanation text.
- Clean up ACP stream lifecycle: clear `activeStreamSessionId` and `chunkHandler` on complete/cancel, null out process reference on close.
- Use `once('close')` with kill fallback and 2s timeout in `disconnect()` to prevent hangs.

### Changed
- Extract drag-and-drop logic into `DragDropManager` component.
- Extract permission approval UI into `PermissionBanner` component.
- Extract inline edit diff panel into `InlineEditPanel` component.
- Replace manual ACP stdout buffer concatenation with `readline` interface for cleaner JSON-RPC line parsing.
- Change agent request timeout from fixed 5-minute total to idle timeout that resets on each streaming chunk.
- Add `Mutex` to `SyncEngine.process()` and session management to prevent concurrent Vault write conflicts and session race conditions.
